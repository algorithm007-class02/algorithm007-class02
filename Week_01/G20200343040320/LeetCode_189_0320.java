//Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negat
//ive.
//
// Example 1:
//
//
//Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
//Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
//Explanation:
//rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
//rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
//rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
//
//
// Example 2:
//
//
//Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
//Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
//Explanation:
//rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
//rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
//
//
// Note:
//
//
// Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different w
//ays to solve this problem.
// Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
